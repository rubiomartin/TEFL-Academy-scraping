## Scrape Job Listings from a Website

This project is part of a freelance application I developed for a company that required collecting data from thousands of job search websites. It uses Node.js and Puppeteer to scrape job listing websites, allowing users to specify how many results to scrape for further analysis.

## Overview

#### The script is designed to:

1. **Extract job listings from specified employment websites**.
2. **Transform and store the extracted data as CSV for easy integration with other tools**.

## Tools
1. **Employment Websites**: The sources of job listing data.
2. **Node.js**: Used to develop the scraping logic.
3. **Puppeteer**: A library for automating Chromium to interact with web pages programmatically.

## Features
- **Configurable number of results**: Specify how many job listings you wish to scrape.
- **Scalable setup**: Easily extended to scrape multiple pages or apply filters for specific job criteria.
- **Headless browser**: Operates using Puppeteer to efficiently interact with web pages.
